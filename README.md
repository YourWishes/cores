# EmulatorJS Cores
This is a simple build script that takes the cores built by
https://github.com/EmulatorJS/build and stores them in an NPM package so that
they can be may be included within a JS package.

In future I plan to make all cores available and have the CI run regularly to
update the package. In addition I would like to ensure only the stable core
builds are included.
